BEGIN Section 0: FILE DESCRIPTION


This file simulates recreational trips (line drops, catches, releases, and end of trips) under differing policy regimes:

The purpose of this simulation is to calculate
	a. WTP for various trips in order to calculate welfare measures
	b. Catch=Kept + discard of both species
 		i.  Kept + discard go into the WTP forumula differentely
		ii.  Kept eventually is output as the total catch of each size of a stock
	c.  This is a Gulf of Maine model only (see parameterization).
		





Changelog:
42a. major bugfix. looped over wrong thing.
41a: People continue to encounter fish when the bag limit is hit.	


OTHER NOTES:

Now the results of the RUM are from Kristy/Scott.

Bugs and to do 
A.  The section in which I "check" whether the ACLs have been hit has been removed.  In part because there is no in season monitoring.  
In part because I moved this part to Mata and I don't know how to code it yet.

B.  I've removed "illegal fishing" (sub-legal) and

/* This code gets the number of linedrops for haddock. I wrote it in two lines to make it explicit:
		temp1=rdiscrete($wave_numtrips,1 ,hadd_catch_class_by_month[.,$wave_of_cy+1])
 THE FIRST LINE creates a Nx1 vector of "index positions" based on the values of the pdf in the $current_wave+1 position in the catch-class-distribution matrix. 
 The +1 accounts for the fact that the the catch_class matrix also has the number of fish in the first column
