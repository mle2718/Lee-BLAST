/* A trip with zero catch and zero release is assumed to have WTP of zero */
/* The mWTP formula is:
kept cod: pi_cod_keep/2pi_cost*1/sqrt(#of kept cod)
released cod: pi_cod_release/2pi_cost*1/sqrt(#of released cod)
kept haddock: pi_hadd_keep/2pi_cost*1/sqrt(#of kept hadd)
released haddock:pi_hadd_release/2pi_cost*1/sqrt(#of released hadd)
 Therefore, the total WTP is calculated by integrating (summing) the marginal WTPs from 0 to the total fish kept
