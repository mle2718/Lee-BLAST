/* This is an auxillary file which I have used to process the "catch" and "release" data to construct total weight.*/
/* This file replaces bio_out.do */

/* Changelog
August 9, 2013

4.0: Now operates probabilistically...

Major revision. This now operate in mata to be synchronized with the new simulation v39+ files.

 Fixed an error regarding the length offsets
3.0: This file is coded in Imperial
3.1: the weights are now handled in the SIMULATION file in mata.
2.0: Instead of using the 'reshape' command, this file has been speeded up by using the 'stack' command. HOWEVER, it is crucial that the length and status variables are 'next to' each other!
1.1: The outputs of this file are now 2 dta files (one for each species).
